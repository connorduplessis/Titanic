# Titanic  
This repository contains R code for my first Kaggle machine learning competition: Titanic. The goal of the competition is to correctly identify which passengers aboard the Titanic survived, and which one's didn't. More information about the competition and the datasets can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

I will be updating the repository as I tune the models and explore the data more.
